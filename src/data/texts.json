The tool provides access to numerous metrics, including case numbers, deaths, testing, vaccinations and interventions. This data is updated daily from Our World In Data (OWID). Users are encouraged to use this interactive tool to drill down into country specific data, to overlay and compare key variables against each other as well as to choose certain time periods or dates. Journalists are also encouraged to download the data for their own analysis."

The dashboard allows users to download data, and country specific charts. Data is updated daily by Africa CDC."
